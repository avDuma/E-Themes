#The Enlightenment Theme that I've made
Here I try to collect all the theme I make. Let's see on details what I have for you:

##Radiance
Port of the Ubuntu GTK Theme. Probably you can get the GTK Theme with your package manager searching for light-themes package
###The Lot's of Color!
Radiance Theme is cool, but maybe you don't like it.
This theme looks good with a lot of GTK themes (Exspecially the Murrina based ones).
You can change your color scheme with Settings -> Look -> Colors!
For example:
  * Border Frame allows you to change the color of border title and toolbar
  * Border Frame Active change the gradient that appears on Selected windows. If you try a dark border, I suggest you to set Border Frame Active Alpha channel to lesser values.
  * Border Title and Border Title Active are generally to change if you change border title.

Unfortunately Elementary widget doesn't be affected for the change with Enlightenment's Colors Manager, so you can change more deeply your theme editing the radconf.edc file.

Here you can change the color value as you want.
After that compile the theme and will look with all the color you like!

At the moment the theme looks pretty good with themes not dark, with light window's colors and dark foreground.

##Bodhi Forum Theme
Theme created inspired by the old Bodhi Forum Layout, there's a GTK 2/3 theme available on this repo, unfortunately not complete, but still usuable and almost done

##OpenGEU Quarto di Luna Theme
There's the two theme created by Luca De Marini and ArtPulse for the latest OpenGEU Version, Quarto di Luna. I've recompiled for new version of Enlightenment and added Elementary Support. Maybe in the future I'll release the GTK 2/3 theme. At the moment there's only the GTK2 theme available for light theme, the Morning Sunshine one.

##Others GTK 2 Themes
There are also a couple of GTK 2 Theme that are ports of old E17 Theme. I'll share with you if someone want to improve, add GTK 3 support or something similar. I've added
  * Japanuma, Japan 2007 port
  * Blinguma, Blingbling port
  * Ceriuma, Cerium port
  * Black&Whituma, Black&White port (old E17 default theme)
  * Gantuma, Gant port
  * LG2 GTK, port of the omonimous theme
  * A-Electric-Blue GTK, port of the omonimous theme
